# Figma Plugin Manifest Explanation

This document explains each field in the `manifest.json` file for your Figma plugin.

```json
{
  // The display name of your plugin as it appears in Figma's plugin menu
  "name": "figmaInspector",
  
  // Unique identifier for your plugin (generated by Figma when you create a new plugin)
  // This ID is used internally by Figma to track your plugin
  "id": "1560229779334461508",
  
  // The Figma Plugin API version this plugin is built for
  // "1.0.0" is the current stable API version
  "api": "1.0.0",
  
  // The main JavaScript file that contains your plugin's backend logic
  // This code runs in Figma's sandbox environment and has access to the Figma API
  "main": "code.js",
  
  // Array of special capabilities your plugin needs
  // "inspect" allows your plugin to read properties of selected nodes without user interaction
  "capabilities": [
    "inspect"
  ],
  
  // Whether to enable experimental/proposed API features
  // Set to true only if you need bleeding-edge features that might change
  "enableProposedApi": false,
  
  // Controls how your plugin accesses document content
  // "dynamic-page" means your plugin can access the current page and switch between pages
  // Other options: "none" (no access), "current-page" (only current page)
  "documentAccess": "dynamic-page",
  
  // Array specifying which Figma editors can run this plugin
  // "dev" means it runs in Figma's development environment
  // Other options: "figma" (main Figma app), "figjam" (FigJam whiteboard)
  "editorType": [
    "dev"
  ],
  
  // The HTML file that defines your plugin's user interface
  // This creates an iframe where your UI runs separately from the main plugin code
  "ui": "ui.html",
  
  // Network access configuration for security
  // Controls which external domains your plugin can communicate with
  "networkAccess": {
    // List of allowed domains for network requests
    // "none" means no external network access is allowed
    // You can specify domains like ["https://api.example.com", "https://cdn.example.com"]
    "allowedDomains": [
      "none"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Key Points:

1. **Plugin Structure**: This manifest defines a Figma plugin with both backend logic (`code.js`) and a user interface (`ui.html`).

2. **Security**: The plugin has inspect capabilities but no network access, making it secure for local operations only.

3. **Scope**: It can access the entire document dynamically and is set up for development environment.

4. **API Version**: Uses the stable 1.0.0 API, ensuring compatibility and stability.

## Common Modifications:

- To allow network requests, replace `"none"` in `allowedDomains` with actual domain URLs
- To run in production Figma, change `"dev"` to `"figma"` in `editorType`
- To add more capabilities, extend the `capabilities` array (e.g., `"textreview"`, `"fileread"`)
